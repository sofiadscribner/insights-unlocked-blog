### Getting Caught Up To Speed

If you've been following my blog, you know I've put lots of time and effort into curating a comprehensive marketing dataset for the 2024 Super Bowl ad lineup. You can check out my data gathering process and get up to speed [here](https://sofiadscribner.github.io/insights-unlocked-blog/blog/super-bowl-data/).

The Super Bowl is perhaps the most important marketing event of the year, and brands line up to pay exorbitant prices for spots that are usually only 30 seconds long. So is their investment worth it? I used my dataset for some exploratory data analysis and also developed a Streamlit app so that you can discover your own insights.

### A Word on Streamlit

This was my first time using Streamlit for a personal project, and can I just say, it is awesome! I have never seen such an easy and seamless way to integrate and present interactive visualizations. For anyone who knows Python, it's very intuitive. I highly reccommend giving it a try. The documentation can be found [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/), and you can check out my code for this entire project in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/sofiadscribner/Super_Bowl_Project).
