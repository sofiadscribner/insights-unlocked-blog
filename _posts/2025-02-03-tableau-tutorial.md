#### What are KPIs?

A KPI is a Key Performance Indicator. KPIs are measurable factors that can demonstrate the success of an organization in achieving their goals. KPIs come from data, and they allow teams to make data-driven decisions about how to move forward. Some examples of KPIs in business include:

- Revenue Growth
- Average Order Value (AOV)
- Profit Margin
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

In order to be an effective KPI, a measure should be specific, relevant, and achievable.

#### Why Tableau?

One extremely effective way to communicate KPIs to stakeholders is Tableau. Tableau allows data analysts to communicate findings in a clear, visually appealing, and interactive format. This is done through dashboards. Dashboards are your new best friend!

The benefits of using a Tableau dashboard to communicate KPIs can't be overstated. Using dashboards, you can create tables and visualizations with filters that stakeholders can interact with. Additionally, Tableau can be connected to a database or spreadsheet and automatically refresh as new data becomes available.

One of the best things about Tableau is that the visualizations you can create with it are ***simply beautiful***. In a matter of minutes, you can produce charts and graphs that are sleek, professional, and very aesthetically pleasing.

So follow along with me as we create a simple KPI dashboard using Tableau's built in practice data, the Superstore dataset!
