## The Challenge

Each April, data viz professionals from around the world participate in the [30 Day Chart Challenge](https://www.linkedin.com/company/30daychartchallenge/posts/?feedView=all). This challenge has been going on for several years, and according to their page, it was created by Cédric Scherer and Dominic Royé, supported by Wendy Shijia and Ansgar Wolsing. This year, the prompts are as follows:

Because I've recently learned Tableau, as well as becoming more confident in my data visualization skills in Python, I was inspired to participate in the challenge! Even though half of this month is going to be consumed by my final exams for school, I still wanted to have a personal project that would remind me why I'm studying statistics and that data can be fun! We will see how this goes. I think it will also be a good test of my diligence.
