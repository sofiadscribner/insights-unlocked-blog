## The Challenge

Each April, data viz professionals from around the world participate in the [30 Day Chart Challenge](https://www.linkedin.com/company/30daychartchallenge/posts/?feedView=all). This challenge has been going on for several years, and according to their page, it was created by Cédric Scherer and Dominic Royé, supported by Wendy Shijia and Ansgar Wolsing. This year, the prompts are as follows:

Because I've recently learned Tableau, as well as becoming more confident in my data visualization skills in Python, I was inspired to participate in the challenge! Even though half of this month is going to be consumed by my final exams for school, I still wanted to have a personal project that would remind me why I'm studying statistics and that data can be fun! We will see how this goes. I think it will also be a good test of my diligence.

I will display each chart and my explanations here, and I'll list the data sources and the software used to create each on at the bottom. Additionally, [this Github repo](https://github.com/sofiadscribner/30-day-chart-challenge) contains all the code and data.

### Category 1: Comparisons

#### Day 1 - Fractions

For the first prompt, I chose to visualize data about the increasing importance of influencer marketing for Gen Z. When I thought of the prompt "fractions," a stacked bar chart immediately came to mind. These charts are great for comparing proportions among different populations.

#### Day 2 - Slope

For day two, I'll be honest, I forgot a little bit about the overarching category of comparisons. I focused a lot on "slope." I'm still getting the hang of how this challenge works! For today's chart I chose to visualize the relationship between the basketball ability of an NBA player and the size of their Instagram following, with a focus on the players that had an unusually low or unusually high number of followers for their skill level.

#### Day 3 - Circular

For today's chart challenge, I chose to use a donut chart to compare the way I allocate my time to each category on Thursdays. Donut charts are a more palletable version of a classic pie chart, in my opinion, but still not the most visually interpretable.

##### Footnotes

*Day 1: I used Tableau to create the chart, and I got the data from [this KS&R article about influencer marketing](https://www.ksrinc.com/how-much-influence-influencers-have/).*

*Day 2: The player performance data was from the [Official NBA Stats site](https://www.nba.com/stats), and the Instagram data was from [this website](https://www.popularbasketballers.com/), which gathers Instagram data for popular basketball players and is updated regularly. The visualization was made using Tableau.*

*Day 3:  I used the seaborn package in Python to create this chart, and the data was calculated from my own life experiences.*
